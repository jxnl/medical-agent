Here's what you can do to feel better:\n\n**For symptom relief:**\n- **Rest** - Your body needs energy to fight the virus\n- **Stay hydrated** - Drink plenty of water, warm tea, or broth to help loosen congestion\n- **Use a humidifier** - Adding moisture to the air can help with stuffy nose and cough\n- **Try over-the-counter medicines** - Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) for aches and fever. Decongestants can help with stuffiness\n- **Gargle salt water** - This can soothe a sore throat\n- **Use throat lozenges or cough drops** - These can provide temporary relief\n\n**When to seek medical care:**\n\nYou should reach out to a healthcare provider if you experience:\n- Fever over 101.3\u00b0F that lasts more than 3 days\n- Symptoms that last longer than 10 days without improvement\n- Severe symptoms like trouble breathing, chest pain, or severe headache\n- Symptoms that get better then suddenly get worse (could signal a secondary infection)\n- If you have underlying health conditions like asthma or a weakened immune system\n\nMost colds just need time and self-care, but if you're worried about your symptoms or they seem more severe than a typical cold, I'd be happy to connect you with one of our healthcare providers who can take a closer look at what's going on.\n\nIs there anything specific about your cold that's bothering you, or would you like to speak with a provider?"

Hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol works well when soap isn't available.\n\n**Avoid touching your face**\nThe flu virus enters your body through your eyes, nose, and mouth. Being mindful of this can make a real difference.\n\n**Keep your distance when possible**\nIf someone around you is sick, try to maintain some space. The flu spreads through respiratory droplets when people cough, sneeze, or talk.\n\n**Boost your immune system**\n- Get enough sleep (7-9 hours for most adults)\n- Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables\n- Stay physically active\n- Manage stress\n- Stay hydrated\n\n**Clean high-touch surfaces**\nRegularly disinfect things like doorknobs, light switches, phones, and keyboards, especially if someone in your household is sick.\n\n**Stay home when you're sick**\nIf you do get the flu, staying home helps protect others and gives your body time to recover.\n\nIs there anything specific about flu prevention you'd like to know more about?"
