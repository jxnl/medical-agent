# Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

This implementation refactored the telehealth chatbot into a reusable service architecture with a comprehensive evaluation framework.

## Components Created

### 1. TelehealthService (`telehealth_service.py`)

A durable service class that manages agent interactions with session persistence:

**Key Features:**
- Session-based conversation storage (JSON files in `.sessions/`)
- Two message processing modes:
  - `send_message()`: Returns complete response
  - `stream_message()`: Yields response chunks in real-time
- Automatic session creation and persistence
- Full conversation history tracking
- Tool call tracking for detecting escalations

**Session Structure:**
```python
Session(
    session_id: str,
    messages: list[dict],
    created_at: str,
    updated_at: str
)
```

### 2. CLI (`telehealth_bot.py`)

Streamlined interactive CLI that uses the service:

**Key Features:**
- Real-time streaming responses
- Automatic session management (creates UUID-based session)
- Visual escalation indicators
- Rich console UI for better user experience
- Error handling with detailed tracebacks

**Streaming Display:**
- Text appears character-by-character as generated
- Tool calls are detected and displayed
- Escalations show a visual indicator

### 3. Evaluation Framework (`evals/framework.py`)

A complete eval system with Dataset, function runner, and scorer:

**Components:**

**Dataset:**
```python
@dataclass
class Dataset:
    name: str
    test_cases: list[dict]  # Each has messages + metadata
```

**Function Runner:**
```python
async def run_function(messages: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
    # Runs service on messages, returns conversation history
```

**Scorer:**
```python
def scorer(test_case: dict, output_messages: list[dict]) -> float:
    # Checks if escalation behavior matches expectation
    # Returns 1.0 for pass, 0.0 for fail
```

**Eval Runner:**
```python
async def run_eval(dataset, function, scorer_fn) -> dict:
    # Runs all test cases and returns results
```

### 4. Test Dataset (`evals/escalation_tests.json`)

15 test cases covering:
- Common illnesses (should not escalate)
- Controlled substances (should escalate)
- Prescription refills (should not escalate)
- Serious symptoms (should escalate)
- Diagnosis requests (should escalate)
- General health info (should not escalate)
- Appointment management (should not escalate)

### 5. Eval Runner (`run_evals.py`)

Executable script that:
- Loads test dataset
- Runs evaluation
- Displays results in formatted tables
- Shows detailed failure information
- Saves results to JSON
- Exits with appropriate status code

## Architecture Changes

### Before:
```
telehealth_bot.py (monolithic)
├── Tools
├── Agent logic
├── CLI interface
└── Message handling
```

### After:
```
telehealth_service.py (reusable service)
├── Tools
├── Session management
├── Agent logic
└── Streaming support

telehealth_bot.py (thin CLI)
└── User interface only

evals/ (evaluation framework)
├── framework.py (Dataset, runner, scorer)
├── escalation_tests.json (test cases)
└── results.json (generated)

run_evals.py (eval runner)
└── Orchestrates testing
```

## Benefits

### 1. Reusability
- Service can be used in CLI, web apps, APIs, etc.
- Session management works across different interfaces

### 2. Testability
- Eval framework allows systematic testing
- Easy to add new test cases
- Automated pass/fail verification

### 3. Streaming Support
- Better user experience with real-time responses
- Same service supports both streaming and non-streaming

### 4. Durability
- Sessions persist to disk
- Conversations can be resumed
- Full history available for analysis

### 5. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Tools, service, CLI, and evals are independent
- Easy to update or extend

## Usage Examples

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Interactive chat with streaming
uv run python telehealth_bot.py
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from telehealth_service import TelehealthService

service = TelehealthService()

# Non-streaming
result = await service.send_message("session-123", "I have a cold")
print(result["response"])

# Streaming
async for chunk in service.stream_message("session-456", "Can I refill my prescription?"):
    if chunk["type"] == "text":
        print(chunk["text"], end="")
```

### Running Evals
```bash
uv run python run_evals.py
```

## Testing Escalation Behavior

The eval framework specifically tests whether the agent correctly:
- **Does NOT escalate** for routine questions (colds, general info, refills)
- **Does escalate** for serious issues (diagnosis, controlled substances, serious symptoms)

The scorer detects escalation by looking for:
- "connect you with"
- "healthcare provider"
- "ticket number"
- "support ticket"
- "let me connect"
- "i'm connecting you"

## Files Changed/Created

### Created:
- `telehealth_service.py` - Core service with session management
- `evals/framework.py` - Evaluation framework
- `evals/escalation_tests.json` - Test cases
- `run_evals.py` - Eval runner script
- `.gitignore` - Ignore session directories
- `README.md` - Usage documentation
- `IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This file

### Modified:
- `telehealth_bot.py` - Now uses service, supports streaming

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements:
1. Add more eval datasets (prescription handling, appointment logic)
2. Implement API endpoints using the service
3. Add metrics and logging
4. Create web UI that uses streaming
5. Add session search and analysis tools
